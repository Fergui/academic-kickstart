    abstract = {A data assimilation system based on the LAPS/STMAS software is tested for a full year (2012) to provide hourly surface analyses at high resolution (3 km) in a complex terrain area centered over Catalonia. In particular, surface observations of more than 150 automatic weather stations (AWS) of the Meteorological Service of Catalonia (SMC) are combined with the operational outputs of WRF-ARW model at 3 km available at SMC. The hourly analyses obtained are verified against independent observations in order to evaluate the system as a real time tool in a small meteorological office. Additionally, an special study is carried out focusing on temperature at 2 m by means of introducing some code modifications in the LAPS/STMAS software. These tests are compared together with a simple multiregression technique exclusively based on observational data (AWS). The comparison shows that the best results are obtained for STMAS when introducing an error weight that depends on the station topography representativeness, instead of just considering a common instrumental error for all the stations. Nevertheless, the multiregression technique still provides more accurate results on temperature and reveals that additional work has to be done in order to improve the system.},

  abstract = {Data assimilation in weather forecasting is a well-known technique used to obtain an improved estimation of the current state of the atmosphere (analysis). The Meteorological Service of Catalunya (SMC) is seeking for a real time high resolution analysis of surface parameters over Catalonia (north-east of Spain), in order to know the current weather conditions at any point of that region. For this purpose, a comparative study among several data assimilation experiments based on LAPS (Local Analysis and Prediction System) and STMAS (Space-Time Multiscale Analysis System) and multi-regression technique designed at SMC, has been performed to determine which one delivers best results. The comparison has been done using as true state independent observational data provided by the Spanish Meteorological State Agency (Agencia Estatal de METeorologia, AEMET). The results show that the multi-regression technique provides more accurate analyses of temperature and relative humidity than the LAPS/STMAS experiments, mainly due to the fact that multi-regression methodology only uses observations and consequently the model biases are avoided.},

  abstract = {Every year, thousands of forest hectares are burned worldwide, causing important consequences on the atmosphere, biodiversity and economy. Proper prediction of the fire evolution allows to manage the fire fighting equipment properly. Therefore, it is crucial to use reliable and fast simulations in order to predict the evolution of the fire. WRF-SFIRE is a wildland fire simulator, which couples a meteorological model called Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) and a forest fire simulator, SFIRE reproducing the interaction between the propagation of the fire and the atmosphere evolution. The mesh resolution used to solve the atmosphere evolution has a deep impact in the prediction of small scale meteorological effects. At the same time, the ability of introducing these small scale meteorological events into the forest fire simulation implies enhancements in the quality of the data that drives the simulation. Therefore, better fire propagation predictions are obtained. However, this improvement can be affected by the instability of the problem to be solved. This paper states an accuracy study changing the mesh resolution when running WRF-SFIRE using as example a real case that took place in Catalonia (northeast of Spain) in 2005.},

  title     = {Spatial and time resolutions: two critical aspects for operational forest fire spread simulation},
  booktitle = {World Conference on Natural Resource Modeling (WCNRM)},
  abstract = {Every year, forest fires burned a huge number of hectares around the world causing important consequences on the atmosphere, biodiversity and economy.  For that reason, the scientific community from different fields have invested lots of efforts in developing models and tools to better understand the behavior of such as phenomenon.  However, this discipline implies the collaboration of scientists from different fields such as fuel modelling, atmosphere behavior forecast, fire modelling, and so on.  Beside the theoretical studies oriented to generate knowledge in order to analyzed past forest fires, this interdisciplinary effort is also focused to generate operational tools that helps firefighter to take decision during and ongoing event.  In this sense, computer science is a key point. The prognostic data will be useful if it is delivered earlier enough to be used as a decision support data at real time.  So, urgent computing will be required. WRF-SFIRE is a wildland fire simulator, which couples a meteorological model called Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) and a forest fire simulator, SFIRE. This coupling strategy reproduces the interaction between the propagation of the fire and the atmosphere surrounding it.  The mesh resolution used to solve the atmosphere evolution has a deep impact in the prediction of small scale meteorological effects. At the same time, the ability of introducing these small scale meteorological events into the forest fire simulation implies enhancements in the quality of the data that drives the simulation, therefore, better fire propagation predictions are obtained.  Furthermore, the data frequency or time resolution of the input data, also has an impact in the prediction results. However, increasing time and spatial resolution directly affects the execution time required to evaluate the mentioned models. So, exploiting the computational resources to their extreme is mandatory to accelerate as much as possible the prediction system in order to be feasible to be used in operational scenarios. This work shows how HPC (High Performance Computing) is the way to accelerate all these processes in order to provide reliable results under strict real time constraints.},

The method can be used to interpolate the fire arrival time between two perimeters by imposing the fire arrival time at the perimeters as constraints. Another application is to incorporate fire detection by including the data likelihood of the observations into the objective function. Also,the ignition point can be estimated by including the location and time of ignition with the unknowns in the optimization process. In a coupled atmosphere model, the fire arrival time found by the optimization is used to generate the fire forcing for the atmospheric model to assure the consistency of the states of the fire and the atmosphere. The method is demonstrated on real fires and helicopter-observed fire perimeters, and on Active Fires detections from the MODIS and VIIRS instruments on satellites.},

  abstract = {Data likelihood of fire detection is the probability of the observed detection outcome given the state of the fire spread model. We derive fire detection likelihood of satellite data as a function of the fire arrival time on the model grid. The data likelihood is constructed by a combination of the burn model, the logistic regression of the active fires detections, and the Gaussian distribution of the geolocation error. The use of the data likelihood is then demonstrated by an estimation of the ignition point of a wildland fire by the maximization of the likelihood of MODIS and VIIRS data over multiple possible ignition points.},

    abstract = {We present a new statistical interpolation method to estimate fire perimeters from Active Fires detection data from satellite-based sensors, such as MODIS, VIIRS, and GOES-16. Active Fires data is available at varying temporal and spatial resolutions (375m and up several times a day, or 2km every 15 minutes), but pixels are often missing due to clouds or incomplete data. The question arises how to fill in the missing pixels, which is useful, e.g., to distinguish in an automated fashion between a single large fire visible as separate clusters of detection pixels because of cloud cover, and separate fires. We process the satellite data into information when was fire first detected at a location, and when was clear ground without fire detected at the location last. We are then looking for the most likely fire arrival time, which satisfies such constraints. Models at various levels of complexity are possible. Our base assumption in the absence of information to the contrary is that the fire keeps progressing without change, which is expressed as the assumption that the gradient of the fire arrival time is approximately constant. The method is then formulated as an optimization problem to minimize the total change in the gradient of the fire arrival time subject to the constraints given by the data. We consider probabilistic interpretations of the method as well as extensions, such as soft constraints to accommodate the uncertainty of the detection and the uncertainty where exactly the fire is within the pixel. This method is statistical in nature and it does not use fuel information or a fire propagation model. The results are demonstrated on satellite observations of large wildfires in the U.S. in summer 2018 and compared with ground and aerial data.},

First, the Active Fire Satellite data from different instruments are processed defining, at each location in the domain, the last time the satellites observed saved ground and the first time they detected fire. Then, these two sets of data are separated using the Support Vector Machine technique giving the best soft margin hyperplane dividing both groups. Finally, the fire arrival time at each location is defined to be the minimum time forming part of the previous separating hyperplane giving promising results experimenting with 5 large wildland fires.},
