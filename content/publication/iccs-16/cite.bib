 abstract = {Data assimilation in weather forecasting is a well-known technique used to obtain an improved estimation of the current state of the atmosphere (analysis). The Meteorological Service of Catalunya (SMC) is seeking for a real time high resolution analysis of surface parameters over Catalonia (north-east of Spain), in order to know the current weather conditions at any point of that region. For this purpose, a comparative study among several data assimilation experiments based on LAPS (Local Analysis and Prediction System) and STMAS (Space-Time Multiscale Analysis System) and multi-regression technique designed at SMC, has been performed to determine which one delivers best results. The comparison has been done using as true state independent observational data provided by the Spanish Meteorological State Agency (Agencia Estatal de METeorologia, AEMET). The results show that the multi-regression technique provides more accurate analyses of temperature and relative humidity than the LAPS/STMAS experiments, mainly due to the fact that multi-regression methodology only uses observations and consequently the model biases are avoided.},
