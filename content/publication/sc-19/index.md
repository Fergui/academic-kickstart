abstract: "We present an interactive HPC framework for coupled fire and weather simulations. The system is suitable for urgent simulations and forecast of wildfire propagation and smoke. It does not require expert knowledge to set up and run the forecasts.  The core of the system is a coupled weather, wildland fire, fuel moisture, and smoke model, running in an interactive workflow and data management system. The system automates job setup, data acquisition, preprocessing, and simulation on an HPC cluster. It provides animated visualization of the results on a dedicated mapping portal in the cloud as well as delivery as GIS files and Google Earth KML files. The system also serves as an extensible framework for further research, including data assimilation and applications of machine learning to initialize the simulations from satellite data."
