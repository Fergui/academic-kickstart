abstract: "Advances in high-performance computing have led to an improvement in modeling multi-physics systems because of the capacity to solve complex numerical systems in a reasonable time. WRF--SFIRE is a multi-physics system that couples the atmospheric model WRF and the forest fire spread model called SFIRE with the objective of considering the atmosphere--fire interactions. In systems like WRF--SFIRE, the trade-off between result accuracy and time required to deliver that result is crucial. So, in this work, we analyze the influence of WRF--SFIRE settings (grid resolutions) into the forecasts accuracy and into the execution times on multi-core platforms using OpenMP and MPI parallel programming paradigms."
