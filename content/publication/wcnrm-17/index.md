abstract: "Every year, forest fires burned a huge number of hectares around the world causing important consequences on the atmosphere, biodiversity and economy.  For that reason, the scientific community from different fields have invested lots of efforts in developing models and tools to better understand the behavior of such as phenomenon.  However, this discipline implies the collaboration of scientists from different fields such as fuel modelling, atmosphere behavior forecast, fire modelling, and so on.  Beside the theoretical studies oriented to generate knowledge in order to analyzed past forest fires, this interdisciplinary effort is also focused to generate operational tools that helps firefighter to take decision during and ongoing event.  In this sense, computer science is a key point. The prognostic data will be useful if it is delivered earlier enough to be used as a decision support data at real time.  So, urgent computing will be required. WRF-SFIRE is a wildland fire simulator, which couples a meteorological model called Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) and a forest fire simulator, SFIRE. This coupling strategy reproduces the interaction between the propagation of the fire and the atmosphere surrounding it.  The mesh resolution used to solve the atmosphere evolution has a deep impact in the prediction of small scale meteorological effects. At the same time, the ability of introducing these small scale meteorological events into the forest fire simulation implies enhancements in the quality of the data that drives the simulation, therefore, better fire propagation predictions are obtained.  Furthermore, the data frequency or time resolution of the input data, also has an impact in the prediction results. However, increasing time and spatial resolution directly affects the execution time required to evaluate the mentioned models. So, exploiting the computational resources to their extreme is mandatory to accelerate as much as possible the prediction system in order to be feasible to be used in operational scenarios. This work shows how HPC (High Performance Computing) is the way to accelerate all these processes in order to provide reliable results under strict real time constraints."
