  Working at Mathematical and Statistical Science Department with Dr. Jan Mandel in some
research lines with a coupled atmosphere-wildland fire model, WRF-SFIRE.

  Main contributions:

* Supporting the components of the WRFx system:
	* wrfxctrl: https://github.com/openwfm/wrfxctrl
	* wrfxweb: https://github.com/openwfm/wrfxweb
	* wrfxpy: https://github.com/openwfm/wrfxpy
	* wrf-fire: https://github.com/openwfm/wrf-fire

* Satellite data acquisition of all L2 Thermal Anomalies/Fire products (MODIS, VIIRS, GOES16, and GOES17) using hierarchy of classes in python in wrfxpy repository.

* New visualization of satellite hot-spots computing the real size of the pixels depending
on the instrument, the scan angle, and the location of the pixels. Example for 2020
California fires at https://arcg.is/1eDHDn.

*  Machine learning application of Support Vector Machine for initialization and data assimilation of a coupled atmosphere-fire simulator (WRF-SFIRE) by estimation of fire
arrival time using satellite data and infrared fire perimeters.

* Execution time analysis of the MPI and OpenMP parallelizations.
* Solving spurious ignition fires of the level set method implemented in WRF-SFIRE in
heterogeneous rates of spread using a local minima strategy.
* Temporal resolution analysis of the potential temperature insertion height from the fire
solution to the atmospheric model using burner ideal experiment as a test case.
* Two perimeter interpolation of fire arrival time using an optimized line search method
through the preconditioned descent gradient and descent multigrid method.
